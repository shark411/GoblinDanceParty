1) How many of steps 1-6 did you complete?
I completed 6 out of 6 steps.
	YEP 1. Random number of stars. (Although, mine is between 100 and 300 instead of 50 and 300.)
	YEP 2. Every star has a different rotation.
	YEP 3. Every star has a different transparency.
	YEP 4. Every star has a different size.
	YEP 5. Every star has a different colour.
	YEP 6. Make it your own. (Replaced STARS with CANDY. Added a background image.)

2) How did you decide when it was appropriate to commit/push your changes?
I tried to push a change for each step, if the step felt short, I combined two steps in my push.
-ADDED PROJECT FILES.
-One push for the random number of stars + star base rotation. 
-One push for continuous star rotation. 
-One push for star colours.
-One push for star transparency. 
-One push for different star scales + changing the background colour. 
-One push for changing the STARS to CANDIES + adjusting the variable names accordingly. 
-My final push will include the addition of my background image + this READ ME and any other minor tweaks.

3) How many commit/pushes did you execute?
In total, I should have 8 commits/pushes.

4) Any specific troubles you had with GitHub or with completing the assignment?
Very few problems. Only the simple ones that come with doing something new. Once I got the hang of things, it went well.
If you must know, my problem was just finding where the changes of my code were displayed (I know it was shown in class,
I just forgot).

5) How did you use AI, if you did?
No AI was used for this assignment. This intelligence is organic, from the crevices of my own brain. Although, I
did get some help from the friends I made along the way (asking questions in class and having some classmates confirm my 
GitHub was working properly). Thanks for explaining everything so well! :)
